   Yuan Xun is hoping that some of these component files

   Whereas the GPL is a strong libre license, the
   Unlicense is a weak libre license. This does not have
   to be a permanent arrangement. Mr Yuan would be
   contented if this happened only for the first one or
   two prereleases of Elastos Coin. That way, any useful
   subroutines of a customary nature contained within the
   codebase may be utilized by those who have possible
   disagreements with the GPL. */
